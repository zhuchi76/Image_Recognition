# ## Question 1
# K-fold data partition: Implement the K-fold cross-validation function. Your function should take K as an argument and return a list of lists (len(list) should equal to K), which contains K elements. Each element is a list contains two parts, the first part contains the index of all training folds, e.g. Fold 2 to Fold 5 in split 1. The second part contains the index of validation fold, e.g. Fold 1 in  split 1

def cross_validation(x_train, y_train, k=5):
    return NotImplementedError


kfold_data = cross_validation(x_train, y_train, k=10)
assert len(kfold_data) == 10 # should contain 10 fold of data
assert len(kfold_data[0]) == 2 # each element should contain train fold and validation fold
assert kfold_data[0][1].shape[0] == 55 # The number of data in each validation fold should equal to training data divieded by K


# ## example
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

X = np.arange(20)
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True)
kfold_data= []
for i, (train_index, val_index) in enumerate(kf.split(X)):
    print("Split: %s, Training index: %s, Validation index: %s" % (i+1, train_index, val_index))
    kfold_data.append([train_index, val_index])

assert len(kfold_data) == 5 # should contain 5 fold of data
assert len(kfold_data[0]) == 2 # each element should contains index of training fold and validation fold
assert kfold_data[0][1].shape[0] == 4 # The number of data in each validation fold should equal to training data divieded by K


# ## Question 2
# Using sklearn.svm.SVC to train a classifier on the provided train set and conduct the grid search of “C”, “kernel” and “gamma” to find the best parameters by cross-validation.

clf = SVC(C=1.0, kernel='rbf', gamma=0.01)

print(best_parameters)


# ## Question 3
# Plot the grid search results of your SVM. The x, y represents the hyperparameters of “gamma” and “C”, respectively. And the color represents the average score of validation folds
# You reults should be look like the reference image ![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1296/1*wGWTup9r4cVytB5MOnsjdQ.png) 

# ## Question 4
# Train your SVM model by the best parameters you found from question 2 on the whole training set and evaluate the performance on the test set.

y_pred = best_model.predict(x_test)
print("Accuracy score: ", accuracy_score(y_pred, y_test))
